# Delta-Kusto

>> Warning:  This repo is no longer updated.  We started Delta Kusto February 24, 2021.  The goal of Delta Kusto was to fill a void in the product to support CI/CD flows.  In November 2024, Kusto went GA with [lifecycle management features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/).  This new feature marks the productisation of CI/CD flows.  For us that also mark the time to stop evolving Delta Kusto.  We are aware those new features are only available in Fabric and no such solution exists for Azure Data Explorer (ADX, Kusto's Azure offering).  For ADX we recommend using [.show database schema as csl script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/management/show-schema-database?view=azure-data-explorer#show-database-schema-as-csl-script) & [.execute database script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/management/execute-database-script?view=azure-data-explorer).
>> Thank you all for using & supporting the Delta Kusto project all those years!

Delta-Kusto is a Command-line interface (CLI) enabling Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI / CD) automation with Kusto objects (e.g. tables, functions, policies, security roles, etc.) in [Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) (ADX) databases.  It can work on a single database, multiple databases, or an entire cluster.  It also supports *multi-tenant* scenarios.

Delta-Kusto is doing what [SQL Database projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/project-oriented-offline-database-development) do for Microsoft SQL:  enabling CI/CD, change management and source control of Kusto databases.  It works with and produces Kusto scripts so it doesn't require a new language / serialization format and can therefore be used with other tools of the ADX ecosystem.

Delta-Kusto runs on Linux, Mac OS & Windows as a stand-alone executable.  It is meant to be used in *headless* mode.

Delta-Kusto works on database structure, **not data**:

* Functions
* Tables / Columns
* Ingestion Mapping
* Policies
* Materialized Views
* Security roles
* External tables
* Continuous Export

## Documentations

See the [documentation](documentation/README.md) for details and [tutorial section](documentation/README.md#tutorials) for different tutorials on Delta-Kusto.

## Overview

The high-level view of delta-kusto is the following:

![Overview diagram](documentation/overview.png)

The green boxes (*current* and *target*) represent [sources](documentation/sources.md).  A source can be:

* ADX Database
* Kusto script

Delta-Kusto computes the *delta* between the two sources.  The *delta* is a Kusto script containing the kusto commands required to take the *current* source and bring it to *target* source.   The *delta script* can be exported as a stand alone file or as a folder hierarchy of scripts for easier readability and git-diff.  It can also be applied to the *current* ADX Database.

Human validation often are required, especially if `.drop` commands are issued (to prevent unwanted data lost).

## Scenarios / Flows

Using different combinations of sources can enable different scenarios:

Current|Target|Scenario|Description
-|-|-|-
ADX Database|Kusto scripts|CI / CD scenario|Push the state if a script set to an ADX database.
Kusto scripts|ADX Database|Determine gap between a script set and existing DB|Computed Delta script shows what would need to be added to the script set to obtain the state of the target database.
Empty|ADX Database|Reverse engineer a database|Special case of the previous scenario.  The *delta* becomes the entire state of the *target*.
Kusto scripts|Kusto scripts|Offline sync|Compute a delta between two script sets.  No live databases needed.
ADX Database|Kusto scripts|Live Sync|Find gap between two databases.

## Limitations

The [current release](https://github.com/microsoft/delta-kusto/releases) of Delta-Kusto includes *functions*, *tables*, *ingestion mappings* & the following *policies*:

* Auto Delete
* Caching
* Ingestion Batching
* Merge
* Retention
* Sharding
* Update

See the [list of issues](https://github.com/microsoft/delta-kusto/issues/) for details on upcoming features and bugs found.

## Alternatives

* [Sync Kusto](https://github.com/microsoft/synckusto) - The Sync Kusto tool was built to help create a maintainable development process around Kusto.
* [Azure DevOps Task for Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/devops) - Azure Pipelines task that enables you to create release pipelines and deploy your database changes to your Azure Data Explorer databases.
